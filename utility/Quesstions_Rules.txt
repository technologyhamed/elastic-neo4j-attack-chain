Start the MCP server

If you need to start, stop, or restart your MCP server, you can use the MCP commands in the Command Palette:

Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)

Select MCP: List Servers

Select the Neo4j Cypher server

Select Start Server


-----------------------------

Summary
The Neo4j Cypher MCP Server provides three tools for natural language database interaction:

get-neo4j-schema - Obtains the database schema to prevent AI hallucinations

read-neo4j-cypher - Executes safe, read-only queries automatically

write-neo4j-cypher - Modifies data with user approval for safety

These tools let anyone interact with Neo4j databases using natural language while maintaining safety through read-only operations and approval workflows

-------------------------
Summary
You used the get-neo4j-schema tool to identify the outgoing relationships for User nodes in the movies database.

In the next challenge, you will invoke the read-neo4j-cypher tool to answer a question about the dataset.

---------------quesion-------

Create a new user named Sarah

Add a 5-star rating from John to The Godfather

--------------quesion-----------
Which movie has the highest IMDB rating, and what is its rating?
---------------------------------

Create a simple command line application in python that:

1. Connects to Neo4j using the Neo4j Python driver using environment variables: NEO4J_URI, NEO4J_USERNAME, NEO4J_PASSWORD.
2. Accepts a Genre name as a text input
2. Runs a Cypher statement that produces a list of the top five movies ordered by their imdbRating in descending order.

Rules:

* The query must filer on non-null values
* You must use tools to understand the schema information
* You must validate your Cypher statement on real data from the database before you write it to the application.

---------------------------
{
  "query": "MATCH (m:Movie) WHERE m.revenue IS NOT NULL RETURN m.title AS title, m.revenue AS revenue ORDER BY m.revenue DESC LIMIT 10"
}

.env
NEO4J_URI=bolt://100.27.16.193:7687
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=seas-cause-women


#-----------------------

You’ve experienced the power of using MCP tools to rapidly prototype and build applications. The agent was able to:

Understand the database schema

Write and validate Cypher queries

Generate a complete Python application

Test the solution end-to-end

This demonstrates how MCP tools can accelerate development workflows, allowing you to focus on the "what" while the AI handles the "how".
